    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>I'm a former business professional who recently decided to join tech! It's been six years since I got my business degree and since that I have had several positions at different companies, mainly in <strong>data analytics</strong> and <strong>sales</strong>. Although, I felt I needed a change and decided to attend the <strong>Technigo Web Development Bootcamp</strong> in the spring of 2022. Today I'm more than happy with that choice as I finally found a work area where I get to use my <strong>creative mindset whilst solving problems</strong>. As I've now graduated I'm thrilled to soon use my new technical skills in a professional environment. Hope you find me interesting! :)</p>
